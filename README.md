## Project vision.
An outdoor road track prediction tool is very essential for professional cyclists, coaches and scientists in order to plan the best training routine, taking weather conditions, aerodynamics, and athletes' stats into consideration.

The traditional way that AUSCYCLING has been used is to use a spreadsheet to record and manage the outcome manually. It can be tuned to supply and demand models to keep up with latest proprietary research and also work better to split courses into appropriate segments. However, as it is a spreadsheet, it is not as portable as a website and it is also hard to add or remove entries. 

On the other hand, the currently available tool called "Best Bike Split" has the advantages of a user-friendly interface, easy-to-change course function and intuitive adjustment of parameters. However, it also has several downsides such as lack of ability to refine physiology parameters for relevance to elite athletes, black box computing, and also high pricing.

Our main goal is to develop a web-based portable application, available both on computers and smartphones which combines the advantages of both traditional methods and existing tools, providing a better solution for all possible users. 

## Tech Stack and Standards.
‚óè	List the likely tech stack for your application (distinguish between back-end and front-end, programming languages and frameworks)
### Frontend
-	Frameworks: ReactJS, it is popular for its ability to display a large amount of components very fast. In addition to that, components can be efficiently reused such as header, footer, tables, etc. Most importantly, React makes it easier to code because it is a combination of HTML and Javascript.
-	Styles: SCSS. It is a stylesheet language which is compiled to CSS. Unlike pure CSS, SCSS allows variables, nested rules, functions, etc. SCSS enables developers to organize large stylesheets well. It is also simple to share design in many other projects.
### Backend
-	Languages: Javascript. Javascript is extremely fast. Being an interpreted language, Javascript reduces pretty much time, namely compilation time. In addition, it is also a client-side script, the connection time between frontend and server is considerably reduced. Moreover, it is a simple language to learn and provides a lot of extended libraries.
-	Database: mySQL. It is considered to be one of the most secure databases so far. It provides high performance, handling large datasets but still ensuring the optimized speed. 
-	Framework (backend): ExpressJS. It is a backend server specifically for Javascript. ExpressJS helps manage servers and routes efficiently. It is designed to save the coding time by half for both web and mobile applications, but still maintains the efficiency. Like Javascript, it is easy to learn and can quickly integrate to any project with simple concepts.
</br>
‚óè	Agree on tools for communication and development (e.g., Slack, IDEs, etc.)

  1.  Communication: Slack. Slack is a widely-used platform across universities and companies around the world. It provides private chats and many types of discussion boards for different groups and departments. In addition, Slack functions with video calls and virtual conferences, which allows hybrid working styles.
  
  2.	IDEs: Visual Studio. It is created by well-known Microsoft, and therefore stable. Visual Studio provides a wide range of languages, including HTML and CSS. It is compatible with multiple Operating systems. VS code also enables auto completion and library search, which saves a lot of time, instead of constantly searching on the internet. In addition, it allows warnings and bug fixers, which is extremely useful in testing.

‚óè	Agree on coding standards: 
  1.  A set of rules that developers must follow in order to keep code files well-organized and easy to maintain in the future.
  2.  We chose to follow coding standards in the Computer Systems course, which clearly defines every single detail of a code file like brackets, characters, and readability,etc.
  3.  Furthermore, these standards align with the ones that we experience in the industry when undertaking internships in several companies across South Australia.
